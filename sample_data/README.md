This folder is intended to contain sample Wikipedia URLs and their corresponding JSON
API outputs from the `/api/quizzes/generate` endpoint.

You can populate it by running the backend locally and saving responses, e.g.:

- `alan_turing.json` for `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing`
- `artificial_intelligence.json` for `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence`
